### First Room

Right click the mirrors to grab and place them, left click to rotate them. Place and rotate them so that the beam of light turns right, left, and right again to shoot the mural with the image of the sun on it.

### Second Room

Right click to grab the crystal ball in the center of the room. Walk around the room and watch the crystal ball, it will glow red more brightly and make more noise when you are closer. When you find the spot the door will open and the ball will stop tracking.

### Third Room

Right click to grab the darts by the entrance. Use them to shoot the four glowing targets on the far wall, as well as the fifth above the entrance to the room.

### Fourth Room

Right click to pickup and swap the placement of the gems to change the heights of the pillars to form a ramp. At the top of the ramp, rotate the mirror to redirect the beam of light into the planet mural.

### Fifth Room

There is simply no way to solve this puzzle :( Entering the hole at the back of the chamber will take you, mysteriously, back to the first room.

If you've made it this far and you're consulting this, note that you may not be stuck! Sometimes you can't solve a puzzle in front of you until you've done something somewhere else or brought something in from another room. There is no penalty for looping through additional times, and in fact, something new will appear in the fifth room your second time through that may take the place of this guide.

If you are still stuck, you can see how to solve the remaining puzzles below.
### Token 1

Bring the crystal ball from the second room into the third room. Here it will track a different spot. Find it to reveal a hidden token in the wall.

### Token 2

Bring the darts from the third room down to the fourth room. Swap the crystals to lower the leftmost pillar as far down as it will go. Use the darts to hit the hidden target to access the hidden token.

### Token 3

Bring the mirror from the top of the ramp in the fourth room to the first room. Place it on the first pillar you see, in the hallway leading into the main room (where you found the introductory note at the start of the game). Using the same configuration of mirrors you used to solve the sun mural puzzle, turn the last mirror the other way to shoot the light into the hallway, and then turn the new mirror you've placed on that pillar to shoot the light into the moon mural in the room you fell into originally. A token will appear in a wall in the hallway.

### Token 4

Bring the darts to the second room. At eye level, in the furthest corner of the room, on the far right side of the wall that has the exit door on its left side, there is the pattern of a target in the pattern of the bricks of the wall. Hitting this target with the darts will reveal a hidden token.

### Final Puzzle

Using the four collected tokens (and reviewing them in the inventory by pressing "I") you can rotate four dials on the wall in the fifth room to match. Each token has a solid line on it which indicates which way the corresponding dial should be turned. Each dial should be turned so that the line on the token would be resting below it.
